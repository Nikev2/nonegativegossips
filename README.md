# nonegativegossips
A small mod that removes gossips from nearby villagers. I made this due to kill nitwits and also solve overpopulation simply kill the villagers you need.

After that execute one command /RemoveNegativeGossip in the chat bar and it should remove gossips from nearby villagers. this only removes the negatives so that the positive gossips stay.

**NOTE THIS COMMAND ONLY WORKS ON THE PLAYER SO MAKE SURE TO USE THE `/execute as @p execute at @p run RemoveNegativeGossip` COMMAND IF YOU PUT IT IN `tick.mcfunction` of your datapack**
